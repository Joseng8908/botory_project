# The Snore Project

## About This Project
* * *
The Snore Project is a deep/machine learning program designed to analyze and understand sleep patterns. This project serves as a key part of my academic coursework this semester.

## Participants
* * *
**Jo Sangyun**
- :school: **School**: Seoultech University
- :globe_with_meridians: **Languages**: C, Go

## Motivation
* * *

## Used Technologies
* * *
- **Python**: The core language for development.
- **Numpy**: For efficient numerical operations and data processing.
- **Pytorch**: For building and training deep learning models.

## Project Goals
* * *
1.  **Deepen Machine Learning Knowledge**: This project is my first step into the field of deep/machine learning. I aim to gain a solid understanding of fundamental concepts and practical application.
2.  **Learn Open-Source Collaboration**: I want to move beyond solo projects and learn how to effectively collaborate with other developers. My long-term goal is to become a contributor to major open-source projects like Moby.
3.  **Holistic Skill Development**: This project is the central piece of a larger academic ecosystem. I plan to integrate it with other class projects: building a web-based interface for data visualization in a web programming course, and managing the server in a Unix programming class. The final goal is to connect all these pieces into a cohesive system.
