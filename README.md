## Project Goals
* * *
1.  **Deepen Machine Learning Knowledge**: This project is my first step into the field of deep/machine learning. I aim to gain a solid understanding of fundamental concepts and practical application.
2.  **Learn Open-Source Collaboration**: I want to move beyond solo projects and learn how to effectively collaborate with other developers. My long-term goal is to become a contributor to major open-source projects like Moby.
3.  **Holistic Skill Development**: This project is the central piece of a larger academic ecosystem. I plan to integrate it with other class projects: building a web-based interface for data visualization in a web programming course, and managing the server in a Unix programming class. The final goal is to connect all these pieces into a cohesive system.
