# The Botory Project

## About This Project
* * *
- Botory (‚ÄúBot + Factory‚Äù) is an automation tool that generates and deploys chatbots from a single YAML file. 
Provide your options and comments in YAML, and Botory takes care of building and deploying the chatbot.
- It helps developers integrate chatbots quickly without spending time on repetitive non-core tasks.

## Participants

## Motivation
* * *
- In real projects, adopting chatbots often involves too many non-core tasks (configuration, deployment, and operational setup).
Botory automates these steps so developers can focus on core logic.  
 
## Used Technologies
* * *
- **Go**: Core implementation
- **Docker**: Packaging and deployment 

## Project Goals
* * *
- Provide a declarative, YAML-based workflow to automate chatbot creation, build, and deployment.
- Enable production-ready chatbots from minimal input (YAML only).
- Gain proficiency in Go and Docker, and release as open source.
